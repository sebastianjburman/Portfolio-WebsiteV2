# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This is my portfolio website where you can find my resume, view my projects, and get in contact with me. I created this website so there is a place where I can share all the projects I have been working on. 

This website was created using Blazor which is within the .NET ecosystem. I chose this framework because I wanted to try out Blazor and see what it would be like to create a website using C#.
