        <p>
            My name is Sebastian Burman, and I'm
            currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Indiana University Southeast. As a passionate
            developer, I love tackling complex problems through coding. Below are some of the technologies I know and
            have experience working with. Please feel free to browse my portfolio and check out the projects I've worked
            on. Thank you for visiting!
